Decision tree analysis was performed on the Mars craters dataset to test nonlinear relationships among a series of explanatory variables and a binary, categorical response variable. To reduce overfit, and as python scikit-learn does not currently implement pruning, the classifier was constrained to a maximum depth of `3`, with minimum number of samples per split of `200` and also minimum samples per leaf of `200`.

The classification tree model here is evaluating *whether or not a crater is large (greater than 3 km in diameter)* as the target called `LARGE_DIAM`. Explanatory variables were included as possible contributors: latitude (`LATITUDE_CIRCLE_IMAGE`), longitude (`LONGITUDE_CIRCLE_IMAGE`), crater depth (`DEPTH_RIMFLOOR_TOPOG`), and number of layers (`NUMBER_LAYERS`).

*Crater depth* was the first variable to separate the sample into two subgroups. Craters with a depth *less than or equal to 5 metres* were more likely to have a *small crater diameter* (that is, a crater smaller than 3 km across).

This was true for most of the cases except if the *number of layers was more than one* and the *latitude was less than or equal to 38.0115* where a series of splits pointed towards that being more likely a *large* crater.

For craters with *depth more than 5 metres*, they were most likely also craters with a *large* diameter (3 km or more across).

Even with the substantial constraints on this tree, there were still nodes and leaves that could have probably been pruned away as they didnâ€™t add much to the classification ability of the model. For example, once you know the depth of a crater is more than 5 metres, the model continues you to point you towards it being a large crater regardless of more splits, and most of the time craters less than 5 metres in depth will be small craters in diameter. It is only the curious shallow craters with layers and latitude less than or equal to 38.0015 that the model suggests a large diameter crater despite the shallow depth. Perhaps this is terrain related.

The confusion matrix looks like this:
